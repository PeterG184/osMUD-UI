  "mudVersion": "This node specifies the integer version of the MUD specification. This memo specifies version 1.",
  "mudUrl": "This URL identifies the MUD file. This is useful when the file and associated signature are manually uploaded, say, in an offline mode.",
  "toFromDevicePolicy": "[RFC8519] describes access lists. In the case of MUD, a MUD file must be explicit in describing the communication pattern of a Thing, and that includes indicating what is to be permitted or denied in either direction of communication. Hence, each of these containers indicates the appropriate direction of a flow in association with a particular Thing. They contain references to specific access lists.",
  "lastUpdate": "This is a date-and-time value of when the MUD file was generated. This is akin to a version number. Its form is taken from [RFC6991].",
  "cacheValidity": "This uint8 is the period of time in hours that a network management station MUST wait since its last retrieval before checking for an update. It is RECOMMENDED that this value be no less than 24, and it MUST NOT be more than 168 for any Thing that is supported. This period SHOULD be no shorter than any period determined through HTTP caching directives (e.g., 'cache-control' or 'Expires'). N.B., the expiring of this timer does not require the MUD manager to discard the MUD file, nor terminate access to a Thing. See Section 16 for more information.",
  "isSupported": "This boolean is an indication from the manufacturer to the network administrator as to whether or not the Thing is supported. In this context, a Thing is said to not be supported if the manufacturer intends never to issue a firmware or software update to the Thing or never to update the MUD file. A MUD manager MAY still periodically check for updates.",
  "mudSignature": "A URI that resolves to a signature as described in this specification.",
  "systeminfo": "This is a textual UTF-8 description of the Thing to be connected. The intent is for administrators to be able to see a brief displayable description of the Thing. It SHOULD NOT exceed 60 characters worth of display space.",
  "mfgName": "These optional fields are filled in as specified by [RFC8348]. Note that firmware-rev and software-rev MUST NOT be populated in a MUD file if the device can be upgraded but the MUD URL cannot be. This would be the case, for instance, with MUD URLs that are contained in 802.1AR certificates.",
  "softwareRev": "These optional fields are filled in as specified by [RFC8348]. Note that firmware-rev and software-rev MUST NOT be populated in a MUD file if the device can be upgraded but the MUD URL cannot be.

    "manufacturer": "This node consists of a hostname that would be matched against the authority component of another Thing's MUD URL. In its simplest form, 'manufacturer' and 'same-manufacturer' may be implemented as access lists. In more complex forms, additional network capabilities may be used. For example, if one saw the line 'manufacturer' : 'flobbidy.example.com', then all Things that registered with a MUD URL that contained flobbity.example.com in its authority section would match.",
    "sameManufacturer": "This null-valued node is an equivalent for when the manufacturer element is used to indicate that the authority found in another Thing's MUD URL matches that of the authority found in this Thing's MUD URL. For example, if the Thing's MUD URL were 'https://b1.example.com/ThingV1', then all devices that had a MUD URL with an authority section of b1.example.com would match.",
    "documentation": "This URI consists of a URL that points to documentation relating to the device and the MUD file. This can prove particularly useful when the 'controller' class is used, so that its use can be explained.",
    "model": "This string matches the entire MUD URL, thus covering the model that is unique within the context of the authority. It may contain not only model information but versioning information as well, and any other information that the manufacturer wishes to add. The intended use is for devices of this precise class to match, to permit or deny communication between one another.",
    "localNetworks": "This null-valued node expands to include local networks. Its default expansion is that packets must not traverse toward a default route that is received from the router. However, administrators may expand the expression as is appropriate in their deployments.",
    "controller": "This URI specifies a value that a controller will register with the MUD manager. The node then is expanded to the set of hosts that are so registered. This node may also be a URN. In this case, the URN describes a well-known service, such as DNS or NTP, that has been standardized. Both of those URNs may be found in Section 17.7.\n\nWhen 'my-controller' is used, it is possible that the administrator will be prompted to populate that class for each and every model. Use of 'controller' with a named class allows the user to populate that class only once for many different models that a manufacturer may produce.\n\nController URIs MAY take the form of a URL (e.g., 'http[s]://'). However, MUD managers MUST NOT resolve and retrieve such files, and it is RECOMMENDED that there be no such file at this time, as their form and",
    "myController": "This null-valued node signals to the MUD manager to use whatever mapping it has for this MUD URL to a particular group of hosts. This may require prompting the administrator for class members. Future work should seek to automate membership management.",
    "directionInitiated": "This MUST only be applied to TCP. This matches the direction in which a TCP connection is initiated. When the direction initiated is 'from-device', packets that are transmitted in the direction of a Thing MUST be dropped unless the Thing has first initiated a TCP connection. By way of example, this node may be implemented in its simplest form by looking"
